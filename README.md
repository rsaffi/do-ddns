# do-ddns
Use DigitalOcean DNS as an alternative to DynDNS, No-IP etc.

This simple shell script updates an IP for a given domain on your DigitalOcean DNS to the current IP from where it's executed and notifies you on Telegram of the updates.

I myself have a group on Telegram with bots for each my private servers. For my home servers in Berlin and SÃ£o Paulo the respective bots post there whenever there's an update for the dynamic IP on my home connections.

I use `telegram-send` (https://pypi.org/project/telegram-send/) for posting a message to the group on Telegram.

For talking to DigitalOcean's API I use `doctl` (https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl).

I won't go through the steps of setting these up, but it's pretty straighforward. Tutorials can be found on each project's repositories.

To use the script, simply call it passing as argument the domain you want to update the IP for:

```
ricardo@homeserver ~ $ /usr/local/bin/do-ddns.sh subdomain.example.org
ricardo@homeserver ~ $
```

Sample output on Telegram:
